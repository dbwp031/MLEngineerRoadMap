# YOLOv7
### Contributions
1. Design several trainable bag-of-freebies methods. (higher performance without additional computational cost.)
2. Found two new issues, (1) namely how re-parameterized module replaces original module, and (2) how dynamic label assignment strategy deals with assignment to different output layers.
3. we propose "extend" and "compound scaling" methods for the real-time object detector that can effectively utilize parameters and computation.
4. the method we proposed can effectively reduce about 40% parameters and 50% computation of SOTA real-time object detector ~. (performance improvement)
